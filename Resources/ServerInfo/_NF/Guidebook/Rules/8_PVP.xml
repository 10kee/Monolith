# 8. Player vs. Player Combat

Proper escalation is always required, unless it is a Antagonist versus a Non-Antagonist.

    - Follow escalation guidelines (see Rule 3) before attacking other players' shuttles.
    -- Atleast one warning is required in a clearly audible fashion before a boarding or engagement is stated.
    - Hostile forces that are known, declared, and confirmed, do not require escalation.
    -- Non-combat roles are not permitted to hunt for these ships, unless there are no combat effective ships remaining to do so.
