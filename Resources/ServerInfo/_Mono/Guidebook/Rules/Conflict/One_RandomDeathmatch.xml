# Conflict Rule 1
## Avoid random deathmatch (RDM).

Players must have valid in-character reasons to kill or attack another player.

- [color=red][bold]Random, unjustified violence (RDM) is not allowed.[/bold][/color]
- [color=green]Civilians[/color] and other non-hostile characters must escalate conflict through [color=green]roleplay[/color] and [color=yellow]clear justification[/color].
-- [italic][color=yellow]This also applies when[/color][/italic] [bold][color=red]combatants[/color] engage with [color=green]non-hostile parties[/color][/bold]; they must initiate through [color=green]roleplay[/color] and cannot treat [color=yellow]neutral[/color] or [color=green]civilian[/color] characters as [bold]valid targets without cause[/bold].
- [color=yellow]Non-lethal options[/color] (such as capturing, negotiating, or detaining) are strongly encouraged to foster deeper storylines and character development.
- [italic][color=gray]Combat should feel like a natural escalation of roleplay—not an excuse for senseless violence.[/color][/italic]

[italic][color=yellow]Faction Warfare:[/color][/italic]
- The 3 main factions ([bold][color=#8B0000]Rogues/The Ashen Republic[/bold][/color], [bold][color=cyan]Trans-Solarian Federation (TSF)[/bold][/color], and [bold][color=#776654]USSP[/bold][/color]) begin each round hostile to one another, but faction wars may evolve through escalation, truces, or treaties as the round progresses.
- [bold]Engagements may begin with combat when clear faction/company hostility is established (e.g., war).[/bold] You are [bold]not required[/bold] to talk before shooting if the situation justifies it.
- [bold]Stealth, deception, and ambush tactics[/bold] are valid forms of engagement, especially for factions like the [bold][color=#8B0000]Rogues[/bold][/color] whose doctrine supports them.
- [color=green]Roleplay is encouraged, especially after conflict[/color]; interrogation, negotiation, or aftermath RP is valuable and enriches the experience.
- [bold]Formal alliances between the 3 main factions are not normally allowed.[/bold] [color=yellow]Temporary ceasefires or neutral interactions may occur[/color] (e.g. negotiation, mutual evacuation), but [bold][color=red]cooperation, coordination, or shared objectives[/color][/bold] are generally prohibited.
-- [bold][color=orange]Temporary ceasefires may be allowed in rare, existential circumstances[/color][/bold] (e.g. Romerol, Letoferol, ADS fleet). These should be [italic][color=yellow]brief, tense, and driven by necessity[/color][/italic]—not convenience or player preference.
-- [bold][color=green]Exception: Rare, well-developed alliances may occur[/color][/bold] if supported by meaningful roleplay, diplomacy, and strong narrative justification. These should be [italic][color=yellow]short-lived[/color][/italic], [italic][color=yellow]goal-specific[/color][/italic] (e.g. retaliation against a dominant faction), and are [bold][color=gray]subject to admin discretion[/color][/bold].

[italic][color=green]We encourage roleplay, but roleplay will not protect you from a bullet.[/color][/italic]
